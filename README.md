# Objective[8]

[![Build Status](https://snap-ci.com/d-cent/objective8/branch/master/build_image)](https://snap-ci.com/d-cent/objective8/branch/master)

A D-CENT project: an application for crowd sourcing and drafting policy.

## Development VM

You can develop and run the application in a VM to ensure that the correct versions of Objective[8]'s dependencies
are installed. You will need [VirtualBox][], [Vagrant][] and [Ansible][] installed.

First, clone the repository.

Navigate to the ops/ directory of the project and run:

    vagrant up development
    
The first time this is run, it will provision and configure a new VM.

When the VM has started, access the virtual machine by running:

    vagrant ssh

The source folder will be located at `/var/objective8`.

After initial setup, navigate to the source directory and apply the migrations:

    cd /var/objective8
    lein ragtime migrate

[Vagrant]: https://www.vagrantup.com
[Ansible]: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html
[VirtualBox]: https://www.virtualbox.org/


### Running the tests

To run all tests, use this command:

```
lein test
```

Commands and aliases can be found in the project.clj file.

### Designing in the browser

This allows you to rapidly design.  You can create jade, modify the sass and js.  These will all be live reloaded.

```
grunt design
```

Open your browser at http://192.168.50.50:2345/_routes to access it from outside the vagrant box.

#### Adding or updating a translation resource

Resources for translating the site into different languages are located under:
/resources/translations/<locale-identifier>.csv

To start translating into a new locale, or to update translations for
an existing locale, there is a helper leiningen task that copies keys
from the default en.csv template into a new or existing templates for
other locales.  This can be run using:
```
lein translation-template <locale-identifier> [& <locale-identifier>]
```
For example:
```
lein translation-template es el
```
will generate or update `/resources/translations/es.csv` and
`/resources/translations/el.csv`.

### Running the app

Add any environment variables you want to use to the ```start_app_vm.sh``` script.

To start the app, run:

    lein start

And then inside the REPL run this for a fake twitter sign-in:

```
(reset :stub-twitter)
```

or this for the normal sign-in options:

```
(reset :default)
```

## Deployment to Heroku

###### Heroku account setup:
- Create a heroku account
- Create new heroku app
- Install heroku tool-belt

###### Setup Twitter API for app:
- create new app on www.dev.twitter.com
- get consumer API key

###### Local heroku configuration:
- add heroku remote: `heroku git:remote -a [APP_NAME]`
- Add heroku postgres add-on: `heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev`

- Set Config Vars on Heroku
	- ADMIN = twitter-[twitter id of admin user]
  - BUILDPACK_URL = https://www.github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi.git
  - BASE_URI = [app uri]
  - HTTPS_ONLY = true
  - SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MINUTES = 10
  - TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET_TOKEN = [twitter consumer api secret]
  - TWITTER_CONSUMER_TOKEN = [twitter consumer api key]
  - API_BEARER_NAME = [anything]
  - API_BEARER_TOKEN = [anything]

- Push to Heroku


## Deployment to ubuntu server (e.g. through digital ocean)

All of the following steps are essential.

#### Provision
- Provision an ubuntu server machine (can be a cloud server such as digital ocean)
- A machine with 1gb RAM and 30gb hard disk has been sufficient for early tests
- Enable connection to the box via ssh - [how to](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2) 

#### Configure with ansible
- Install Ansible
- In file *ops/digital_ocean_box.inventory* replace the IP address with the IP address of your ubuntu server machine
- Create a Twitter developer account and "app" for user authentication in the app
- Create an AWS (Amazon Web Services) account which will be used to store database backups in S3
- Use the *objective8_config_template* found in the */ops* directory and replace the empty strings with your credentials and save it for use in the next step. Take note of the file path.
- Create a */ops/roles/nginx/files/secure/* directory, and copy your SSL certificate and key files there, with the names *objective8.key* and *objective.crt*.

Run Ansible playbook:

  The following command will install necessary packages and configure them (it will take a few minutes).
  It will require choosing a database password and supplying your Amazon S3 credentials for automatically backing up (encrypted) the database to an Amazon S3 bucket: 
  ```
  ansible-playbook ops/digital_ocean_box_playbook.yml -i ops/digital_ocean_box.inventory --extra-vars "CONFIG_FILE_PATH={config file path from the previous step without the curly braces}"
  ```
  
#### Deploy application to the server
Run:

  The following will copy the application to the server and start it running as a service on a docker container.
  Once complete you should be able to access the app at your IP address.

  ```
  chmod +x deploy_prod.sh
  REMOTE_USER={username on server} SERVER_IP={IP address of server} ./deploy_prod.sh
  ```

## Docker

To run the application you'll need the following containers:

* Postgresql
* Nginx
* Objective8

First, open the *objective8_docker_config_template* found in the */ops* directory, enter your credentials and save the file. This will be used in both postgres and objective8.

#### Postgres Container

To start a postgres docker container, using the relative path for your config file.

    docker run -d --env-file=<docker config relative file path> -v /data --name pg_objective8 postgres

#### Nginx container

Nginx is used to add SSL protection and act as a reverse proxy. to use it you need:

* an SSL certificate and key
* a dhparam.pem file
* an nginx.conf file

You can acquire an SSL certificate and key online inexpensively. You should receive a pair of files, for instance objective8.crt and objective8.key. Store them in their own directory somewhere safe.

You can generate a dhparam.pem file by running: 
    
    openssl dhparam -rand â€“ 2048 > dhparam.pem
 
You can create an nginx.conf file by copying the following into a new file and replacing the <> appropriately:

    events {
    }
    http {
      server {
      listen 80;
      return 301 $request_uri;
      }
      
      
      server {
        listen 443 ssl;
      
        ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/<file name for SSL certificate>;
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/<file name for SSL key>;
      
        ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:32m;
        ssl_session_timeout 10m;
      
        ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/cert/dhparam.pem;
        ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.1 TLSv1;
      
        # trailing '/' after port means app doesn't know about '/as2/'
        location /as2/ {
          proxy_pass http://<docker ip>:7000/;
        }
        # no trailing '/' after port means app knows about '/api/v1/'
        location /api/v1/ {
          proxy_pass http://<docker ip>:8081;
        }
        location / {
          proxy_pass http://<docker ip>:8080;
        }
      }
    }


Finally, run the following command:

    docker run -v <absolute path to SSL certificates and keys directory>:/etc/nginx/ssl -v <absolute path to conf file>/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf -v <absolute path to dhparam file>/dhparam.pem:/etc/nginx/cert/dhparam.pem -p 443:443 -d --name nginx-container nginx
        
#### Objective8

To start the docker image with a custom colour scheme, create a file that defines the primary colour scheme:

    $color1: #007E84;
    $color2: #9C0F83;
    $color3: #ffbf47;

The following command will start the Objective[8] image with your custom colour scheme, favicon and Stonecutter icon on the sign-in page. Since these are optional changes, you can omit any of the lines which pass those files into the docker container.

    docker run -d --env-file=<relative path to objective8 docker config> \
    -v <absolute path to colour scheme>:/usr/src/app/assets/scss/root/_theme.scss \
    -v <absolute path to custom favicon>:/usr/src/app/resources/public/favicon.ico \
    -v <absolute path to stonecutter sign-in icon>:/usr/src/app/resources/public/stonecutter-sign-in-icon.png \
    -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 --link pg_objective8:postgres --name objective8 dcent/objective8
